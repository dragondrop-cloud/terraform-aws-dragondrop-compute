# terraform-aws-dragondrop-compute
Terraform module for deploying the compute services needed to run dragondrop.cloud within your AWS cloud environment.

# dragondrop Self-Hosting Compute
Terraform code for deploying the compute resources needed to run dragondrop.cloud within your AWS environment.

## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own cloud environment.

It defines a [Container-based Lambda Function](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/ecs-fargate-http-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a provisioned ECS Fargate Task.

The url for this Cloud Run Service is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition as that Job's "HTTPS Url".

The ECS Fargate Task hosts dragondrop's proprietary container. All environment variables that need to be configured are references
to secrets within AWS Parameter Store, and can be customized like any other secret.

### Security When Using This Module
This module creates a new IAM role, "dragondrop HTTPS Trigger Role" which has the minimum permissions needed to evoke
the created Fargate Task. This role is assigned to a new service account, and that service account is the service account used by both the
Containerized Lambda and Fargate Task provisioned by this module.

Lastly, that service account is granted Secret Accessor privileges on only the secrets referenced by the Fargate task as
environment variables.
