| **s3_state_bucket_name**_      | string      | Optional name of the S3 bucket used for storing Terraform state. The ECS Fargate task created by the module will have read access to this bucket. |
| **https_trigger_lambda_name**_ | string      | Name of the lambda function created by the Module which services as an HTTPS endpoint.                                                            |

## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own cloud environment.

It defines a [Lambda Function](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/ecs-fargate-http-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a provisioned ECS Fargate Task.

The url for this lambda function is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition as that Job's "HTTPS Url".

The ECS Fargate Task hosts dragondrop's proprietary container. All environment variables that need to be configured are references
to secrets within AWS Parameter Store, and can be customized like any other secret.

### Security When Using This Module
This module creates two new roles with minimized IAM permissions:
1) "dragondrop-lambda-https-trigger" which has the minimum permissions needed to evoke the created Fargate Task.
The Lambda function created by this module is granted [this role](./modules/lambda_https_endpoint/data.tf).

2) "dragondrop-fargate-runner", an IAM role with Secret Accessor privileges on only the secrets referenced by the Fargate task as
environment variables. Also has read-only access to then entire AWS account, and optional read-access to the s3 bucket containing 
Terraform state files. The ECS Fargate task created by this module is granted [this role](./modules/lambda_https_endpoint/).
